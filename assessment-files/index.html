  <h1>The Trouble with Bears</h1>
  <p><strong>By Evan Wild</strong></p>

  <p>
    Tall, lumbering, angry, dangerous. The real live bears of this world are proud,
    independent creatures, self-serving and always on the hunt for food. Nothing like the
    bears you see on TV, like Baloo from the documentary “The Jungle Book.”
  </p>

  <p>
    So what are bears really like, and why does the world's media portray them with such a
    skewed vision? In this article, we try to answer those questions and give you a real
    insight into the life of the bear.
  </p>

  <h2>Types of Bear</h2>

  <p>
    Bears come in two varieties — large and medium. You don't get small bears. If you saw
    a small bear, it was probably a baby bear (a cub) from another species.
  </p>

  <p>
    Bears can also be classified by their habitat. Both large and medium bears can live in
    urban areas or the countryside. The table below gives you some useful facts about bears.
  </p>

  <h2>Habitats and Eating Habits</h2>

  <p>
    Wild bears eat a variety of meat, fish, fruit, and nuts. They usually hunt for food in
    woodland or rivers, but will occasionally search farms and homes for food.
  </p>

  <p>
    Urban bears have largely abandoned the old ways. They will hunt if necessary, but they
    prefer easily accessible urban food like dumpsters and fast-food outlets.

  <h2>Mating Rituals</h2>

  <p>
    Bears are romantic creatures and look for mates they can spend the rest of their lives
    with. They prepare their homes with decorations or music depending on their habitat.
